# Queue

A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.

Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure
1. Insert/Enqueue = Insert an element in the queue.
2. Delete/dequeue = Delete an element from the queue.
3. Display = Display the whole queue.
4. Exit = Exit from the queue.

Applications of queue:
1. Task scheduling in operating systems
2. Data transfer in network communication
3. Simulation of real-world systems (e.g., waiting lines)
4. Priority queues for event processing queues for event processing
